    <p class="text-muted">
        This application is the Menu UI for an animatronics-themed restaurant in a theme park.
        It is designed to integrate with four other teams in the enterprise system:
        POS, Database, Inventory, and Transactions.
    </p>

    <ul class="text-muted">
        <li>The <strong>Menu UI</strong> lets guests browse dishes, view nutrition, and add items to a cart.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Database team</strong> will provide real menu &amp; item data via REST APIs.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Inventory team</strong> will track stock when orders are placed.</li>
        <li>The <strong>POS/Transactions teams</strong> will handle payments and receipts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-muted mb-0">
        In this sprint, all integration points are coded and ready. When the other teams share their
        API URLs, we only need to update the service configuration without changing the UI.
